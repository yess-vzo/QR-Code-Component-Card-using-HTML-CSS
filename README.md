# QR-Code-Component-Card-using-HTML-CSS
Front End Mentor Challange


The following repository contains an activity for the Frontend Mentor platform, in the “challenges” category.
The objective of the challenge was to develop a component that includes a QR code and make it look as similar as possible to the provided design.

To do so, I used HTML and CSS, following the BEM methodology and using a Google Fonts font. Finally, I uploaded my code to GitHub and published it through GitHub Pages.
I started the project by setting up the font in the HTML file, inserting the corresponding links in the <head> section and linking the style.css file.

For the layout in the <body>, I used a <div> type container to which I assigned the class "card-main" to indicate its main function in the interface. Within this container, I added two <div> elements that act as block elements and describe their relationship with the main block using the classes "card__image" and "card__text". 
Finally in the <div> with the “card__text” class, I added <h3 tag> and <p tag> with the “card__text--title” and “card_text--paragraph” modifiers.
